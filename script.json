He worked for a number of large public and private sector clients around the UK, providing IT risk assurance & advisory services.\nSeeking a new challenge, he left EY in 2009 to join British American Tobacco (BAT).\nThanks to BAT's large global footprint, David discovered his love for travel and cultures as he travelled the globe to perform audits at the company's various locations in Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa and Americas.\nThrough those travels, David found love and began a long-distance relationship with his partner, who lived in Florida, US. After being together for three years, David decided to make it permanent and married his beloved, packing up his things in London and moving to the US in the process, where he now resides.\nWhat else would you like to know about him? %[Interests](postback:interests) %[Profile](postback:profile)",
