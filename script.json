He pursued his degree whilst working as a financial auditor, but soon transferred into the IT Audit & Assurance function once his computer proficiency was recognised.\nThere he developed his skills to focus on process auditing, technical security of infrastructure and data analytics services.\nThe downward turn in Zimbabwe's economy forced him to move into the private sector, where he served as IT Manager for a stockbroker and its subsidiaries for a brief period before taking a position offered by Ernst & Young (EY) in the United Kingdom.\nDavid emigrated to the UK in 2006, where he rejoined EY for another 3 years. He worked for a number of large public and private sector clients around the UK, providing IT risk assurance & advisory services.\nSeeking a new challenge, he left EY in 2009 to join British American Tobacco (BAT).\nThanks to BAT's large global footprint, David discovered his love for travel and cultures as he travelled the globe to perform audits at the company's various locations in Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa and Americas.\nThrough those travels, David found love and began a long-distance relationship with his partner, who lived in Florida, US. After being together for three years, David decided to make it permanent and married his beloved, packing up his things in London and moving to the US in the process, where he now resides.\nWhat else would you like to know about him? %[Interests](postback:interests) %[Random fact!](postback:random_fact) %[Profile](postback:profile)",
